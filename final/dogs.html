                            She can run like the wind, jump like a roo and will join in any reindeer game that you have planned.
                            
                            This is a social, delightful Rottweiler who will be great in any home.

                            We worked our tushies off and look at this adorable pup now! He is healthy and happy and eats like a horse.
                            
                            Guac is about 10 weeks old as of mid-May and 9 pounds. (He was 3 pounds when we got him last month).
                            
                            Are we sure of his breed? Nope. Tijuana said they were German Shepherd mixes. We have our doubts. But we do know he is bright, alert, adorable and wil make some family a great addition.
                            
                            Guac will be neutered prior to adoption."><img src="http://dawgsquad.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/url-2.jpg" alt="" ></a>

                            Yes, she’s a little on the plump side but she loves her walks and that added weight should come off in no time. Good food and exercise are always important for any dog.

                            Florence is bright, alert and very loving.   She looks up at you and her eyes are just begging for you to love her, treat her kindly and give her lots of belly rubs.
                            
                            She walks nicely on a leash but is easily distracted….she may have never been out of a yard prior to joining the Squad.    Florence is learning her commands – she is so willing to please – she wants to do whatever will make you happy.
                            
                            We can’t say enough about this sweet dog.   You have to meet her!"><img src="http://dawgsquad.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/urtl-e1532465304942.jpg" alt="" ></a>
